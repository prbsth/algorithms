# algorithms
implementation of some algorithm problems to learn. 
Most importantly, the graph.cpp file tackles the creation of an MST in 3D (or higher) dimensional space using an implementation of Prim's and Kruskal's algorithm. Me and my friend made the fastest algorithm in the class' tenure. (this was made by me and billy. David J Malan was our intro CS professor whose name was added for comical reasons).

This folder also contains implementation of fast matrix multiplication algorithms and some randomized algorithms for hill climbing.
